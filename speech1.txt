I don't know what to say really
Three minutes to the biggest battle of our professional lives all comes down to today
Either we heal as a team or we are going to crumble
Inch by inch play by play till we're finished
We are in hell right now, gentlemen believe me and we can stay here and get the shit kicked out of us or we can fight our way back into the light
We can climb out of hell
One inch, at a time
Now I can't do it for you
I'm too old
I look around and I see these young faces and I think I mean I made every wrong choice a middle age man could make
I uh
I pissed away all my money believe it or not
I chased off anyone who has ever loved me
And lately, I can't even stand the face I see in the mirror
You know when you get old in life things get taken from you
That's, that's part of life
But, you only learn that when you start losing stuff
You find out that life is just a game of inches
So is football
Because in either game life or football the margin for error is so small
I mean one half step too late or to early you don't quite make it
One half second too slow or too fastand you don't quite catch it
The inches we need are everywhere around us
They are in ever break of the game every minute, every second
On this team, we fight for that inch On this team, we tear ourselves, and everyone around us to pieces for that inch
We CLAW with our finger nails for that inch
Cause we know when we add up all those inches that's going to make the fucking difference between WINNING and LOSING between LIVING and DYING
I'll tell you this in any fight it is the guy who is willing to die who is going to win that inch
And I know if I am going to have any life anymore it is because, I am still willing to fight, and die for that inch because that is what LIVING is
The six inches in front of your face
Now I can't make you do it
You gotta look at the guy next to you
Look into his eyes
Now I think you are going to see a guy who will go that inch with you
You are going to see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he knows when it comes down to it, you are gonna do the same thing for him
That's a team, gentlemen and either we heal now, as a team, or we will die as individuals
That's football guys
That's all it is
Now, whattaya gonna do?
